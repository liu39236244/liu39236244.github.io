# 好好说话阅读

## 好好说话就是改变命运（To speak well is to change your fate.）

  好好说话！不要看不起自己，更不要高看自己。
  （Speak up!Don't look down on yourself, and don't look down on yourself.）

## 心直但不可以口快（The heart is straight but not the tongue.）
  * 1.
  不要认为心直口快是你的优点，更不要自以为是的认为你比那些把话藏在心里的人更加高尚。
  Don't think that being outspoken is your advantage, not to think that you are more noble than those who hide their words in your heart.
  * 2.
    你的话应该给你留下余地（Your words should leave room for you.）
